  <li> So as you read from above my first job was at Congressional Country Club where I was a poolside server. I worked there for 5 summers starting in the summer of 2015</li>
  <li> More recently I currently work for Rotowrire, a sports writing company based in Madison. I just started a spring internship program with them! </li>
  <li> This summer I plan to work for the engineering company Jacobs this summer. I will be helping with their talent acquisition marketing strategy. </li>
