<p> While I like to think I have a lot of important skills that are helpful in a workplace environment, these are my most important skills: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Leadership, I love to take leadership roles when working in teams because I'm great at communicating objectives and motivating team members. </li>
  <li> Communication, I am very responsive and great at responding in a respectable manner. </li>
  <li> Organization, I am great at planning and managing my workload for a given time period and I am very good at meeting the goals I set. </li>
</ul>
